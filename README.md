# Performance analysis of the SparseTensor class in Pytorch Geometric

The main file used to run the analysis in Google Colab is `sparsetensor-colab.ipynb` and the script used for running the analysis in HPC is `sparsetensor-hpc.py`.

All of the figures can be seen in the folder `figures/` and information about the GPUs used and the output of the code in the folder `outputs/`.
